# Abdurrehman Abid  
**Building systems that book, schedule, and scale**  
Full-stack developer focused on high-impact web products — from booking infrastructure to homecare platforms.

---

### What I'm building now
- Scalable booking and scheduling systems with Google Meet integration and real-time availability
- OTP-based authentication flows for secure, seamless user access
- Homecare-specific platforms — client management, visit scheduling, and caregiver coordination
- Payment-backed SaaS logic — Stripe integration, subscription handling, and risk-aware architecture

I don't just build features. I build systems that solve real business problems — with clean UI, solid architecture, and a clear path to scale.

### Featured projects

**Homecare Operations Platform**  
A full-stack system for homecare agencies to manage clients, caregivers, and recurring visits. Includes scheduling logic, caregiver assignment, and client portals.

**Smart Booking API with OTP + Google Meet**  
Booking infrastructure with OTP verification and automatic Google Meet generation. Built for scalability — handles timezone logic, double-booking prevention, and calendar sync.

**Session-Based Scheduling Tool**  
Lightweight but powerful scheduling interface with real-time availability. Built with MVPs in mind — easy to drop into existing products.

### My philosophy

> Build for impact, not for show.

I focus on:
- Product thinking — features should solve real friction points
- Execution discipline — MVPs that actually scale
- Long-term viability — clean code, risk-aware decisions, and systems that grow with users

I don't chase trends. I build products that work — and keep working.

### Let's build
I'm open to collaborating on:
- Booking or calendar-based systems
- Homecare or service industry platforms
- SaaS tools with real-world complexity
